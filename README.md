# Halcyon for Mastodon
A Mastodon web client that looks like Twitter

>The original author of this genius piece of software was inactive for a while and then shut down his demo instance and deleted this repository. I love Halcyon, it's the thing which makes Mastodon the best social network in the world. I took the Code from the Halcyon fork of cybre.space which still works but doesn't seem to get updates, too. I uploaded it here to make the original link work again and don't link into the big nothing. I'm working on much other stuff, too, what is why I won't be very active here in the near future but I do things which are required to keep it working and if I have much more time, I already know some nice features which could come. As for now I don't have an own demo instance but the one from cybre.space works pretty good and when I changed many things, I will open an own one.
